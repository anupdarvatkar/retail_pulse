# Spike: [Descriptive Title of the Spike]

This directory contains experimental code for [briefly describe the purpose of the spike, e.g., "evaluating a new data processing library"].

## üéØ Objective

The primary goal of this spike is to:
*   [List the main objective, e.g., Evaluate the performance of Google Cloud Vision API for product detection.]
*   [Another objective, e.g., Determine the feasibility of using Pub/Sub for real-time event processing.]

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip`
*   Google Cloud SDK

1.  **Authenticate with Google Cloud:**
    If you are running this locally and need to authenticate to Google Cloud services, run the following command and follow the prompts:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**

    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    Install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Spike
