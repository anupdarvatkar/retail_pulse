Amazing device with disappointing battery","Great laptop in this price segment. Everything is perfect except for battery. But in this price, it's justified that there will be one disadvantage and it is battery. One needs to keep it plugged in. It will only last for 1 hour on normal usage.

Charging Issue and Screen Flickering in New Laptop ‚Äì Needs Immediate Attention
Review
I recently purchased this laptop, and unfortunately, I'm facing an issue with the charging. Whenever I plug it in to charge, the screen starts blinking intermittently, and for a few seconds, it even goes completely black. This happens every time I plug it in, regardless of whether it's on battery or plugged into the charger.
I have attached a video to showcase the problem for a clearer understanding. Despite the laptop being brand new, this issue seems to persist. I‚Äôve tried reconnecting the charger, performing a power reset, and checking for any loose connections, but the problem still exists.
Pros
- The laptop is fast and smooth when it's working fine.
- The design and build quality are great.
**Cons**:
- Screen flickering and blackouts during charging.
- Battery charging seems inconsistent at times.
I hope the manufacturer can look into this issue and provide a solution, as this is a significant concern with a new device.
Bettery problem drain.

// this is after using for 9 months
I used my system for coding and programming purposes not for gaming...
My laptop battery run only for 90min . After this time u need a charging port. And if you want to use it for medium size gaming purpose then first you put machine in charging port and then Play.
So main problem it battery has very short time duration. You can't work for 4 to 5 hrs without electricity.
Overall it is a good machine ...for coding and programming purpose.
// this is my first review
Performance is good and easy to use and ,,it is capable to run medium size games ...
I am using for it coding and programs purpose ...to u can easily do multi tabing without any lagging.
Display quality is good and u can watch it at 178¬∞ also with clear vision.
I used it for one month and I face one problem that is battery...
Battery charging is very fast it allmost full  within 50mins ....
But it drains battery in 90min approx.
So if you want to use it for 3 to 4 hrs battery back than it is not a good choice
Or
Use it with continuous on charging mode .
Heating issues:-
Laptop get heated if it doesn't get proper ventilation so use it on a laptop stand so that is remain cool and gives you smooth performance.

Placeholder,Best of Best‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•,"Smooth display and attractive RGB Keyboard which gave a complete gaming look..
Without plugin it uses igpu and battery last for min 3 hrs which is good..
Obviously we can't expect a much battery life during gaming..
7445hs handles the day to day tasks effortlessly..
With the combination of rtx 3050, it is a solid performance beast..
Has dts, delivers good quality of Sound..
Minimal heat level.. superb heat dissipation through dual fan..
It's bit heavy..
Overall, worth a every penny.
